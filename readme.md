This is our AP Computer Science A final: a simple Wordle cracker that works by filtering words by characters.

How to run:
Download jar file and then run it using terminal or a similar program, like you would run a normal jar file without a gui (ex: java -jar jarName.jar).

Select the number of wordles you want to solve (only used in guess numbers).

If you incorrectly enter information, the program may terminate, this is normal, just re-enter the info correctly after restarting the program.

How to solve a dordle, quordle, octordle or sedecordle:
Run multiple instances of the program using multiple terminal windows or tabs, this allows you to run one instance per terminal tab: one instance per wordle.
